This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: omitting the HTTP status code in a response.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when a successful response doesn't explicitly set a status code (e.g., 200 OK), which might cause unexpected behavior in the client application and debugging challenges. The solution involves adding the appropriate HTTP status code to all responses, ensuring consistency and clarity.
